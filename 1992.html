<p>Touchscreens werent exactly nonexistent back in the early 90s, but they werent super common, either. Simon is believed to be the first commercially available phone with a touchscreen, though earlier PDA devices had showcased various portable touchscreen technologies. Simonâ€™s interface could be navigated with an included stylus, and somewhat less easily with a finger.</p>
