<p>Mechanical acoustic devices existed for transmitting speech and music over a longer distance before electromagnetic telephones were created. This separation was wider than what is typical for direct speech. The first mechanical telephones used pipes or other physical media to transmit sound. The "lovers' phone," also known as the acoustic tin can phone, has been around for generations. It connects two diaphragms with a taut string or wire, and instead of using a modulated electric current to transfer sound, the mechanical vibrations that travel over the wire from one to the other do it. The traditional illustration is the kid-friendly toy created by tying the bottoms of two paper cups, metal cans, or plastic bottles together with tautly pulled rope.</p>
