<header>information on 1960 phones</header>

<main>

<p>In the USA, desk phones with rotary dials were the norm at the beginning of the 1960s. They were always polished black, occasionally red, or "industrial" dark green. Designers of phones first began considering the aesthetics of the actual device about 1962 or 1963. It was discreetly small enough to put on a nightstand next to a bed. People used phones that had metal cables woven through wooden boards. You had to connect the phone's wire into a wall to use it. You would have to hold the phone up to your ear after speaking into it.
