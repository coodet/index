<main>

<p>In 1973, Motorola created the first mobile phone. The portable device had a brick-like form and weighed about 2.4 pounds. Its designation was DynaTAC 8000X.

    Only 30 minutes of call time could be obtained from the device, and that was after an enormous 10 hours of charging!
    
    An executive at Motorola named Martin Cooper placed the very first call. He made a call to Dr. Joel Engel, an engineer at Bell Labs, their rival company.</p>
