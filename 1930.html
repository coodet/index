<p>The majority of phones in the 1930s resembled rotary telephones. A handset receiver with an earpiece and a mouthpiece was attached to either a round or square base with a numerical dial that rotated when you dialed. The base and the handset were connected by a cord. The first telephone produced in the 1930s was the Model 202. It was an oval-shaped phone with a dial block attached. The Model 202 was primarily a desktop phone that was utilized by businesses.</p>
